GitHub collaboration centers on Git version control, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overriding each other's changes. Key features like Pull Requests, Issues, and Code Reviews facilitate structured communication, ensuring code quality and streamlined project management. This ecosystem empowers teams to merge contributions efficiently, track progress, and maintain a transparent history of all project modifications.
